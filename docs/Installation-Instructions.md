## Install the Azure Marketplace SaaS Accelerator using Azure Cloud Shell

You can install the SaaS Accelerator code using a __single command__ line within the Azure Portal ([video tutorial](https://youtu.be/BVZTj6fssQ8)).

> Note: use the Azure Cloud Shell's PowerShell shell, not the default bash shell.

Copy the following section to an editor and update it to match your company preference. 
   - Replace `SOME-UNIQUE-STRING` with your Team name or some other meaningful name for your depth. (Ensure that the final name does not exceed 24 characters)
   - Replace `user@email.com` with a valid email from your org that will use the portal for the first time. Once deployed, this account will be able to login to the administration panel and give access to more users.
   - [optional] Replace `MarketplaceSaasGitHub` under `ResourceGroupForDeployment` with a value that matches your comany's naming conventions for resource groups
   - [optional] Replace `East US` with a region closest to you.

``` powershell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef; `
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator.git -b 6.1.2 --depth 1; `
cd ./Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator/deployment; `
.\Deploy.ps1 `
 -WebAppNamePrefix "marketplace-SOME-UNIQUE-STRING" `
 -ResourceGroupForDeployment "marketplace-SOME-UNIQUE-STRING" `
 -PublisherAdminUsers "user@email.com" `
 -Location "East US" `
 ```

The script above will perform these actions:
   - Create required App Registration for SaaS Marketplace API authentication
   - Create required Aoo Registration for SSO on your Landing Page
   - Deploy required infrastructure in Azure for hosting the landing page, webhook and admin portal
   - Deploy the code and database on the infrastructure.


 The following are optional parameters that you can include in the deployment  (see parameter description below for details)
 
 ``` powershell
 -TenantID "xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx" `
 -AzureSubscriptionID "xxx-xx-xx-xx-xxxx" `
 -ADApplicationID "xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx" `
 -ADApplicationSecret "xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx" `
 -ADMTApplicationID "xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx" `
 -LogoURLpng "https://company_com/company_logo.png" `
 -LogoURLico "https://company_com/company_logo.ico" `
 -Quiet
 ```

## Update to a newer version of the SaaS Accelerator

If you already have deployed the SaaS Accelerator, but you want to update it so that you take advantage of new features developed, you can run the following command:

*you need to ensure that you use the same parameters you used in the initial deployment 

``` powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator.git -b <branch-to-deploy> --depth 1; `
cd ./Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator/deployment; `
.\Upgrade.ps1 `
 -WebAppNamePrefix "marketplace-SOME-UNIQUE-STRING" `
 -ResourceGroupForDeployment "marketplace-SOME-UNIQUE-STRING"" `
 ```
