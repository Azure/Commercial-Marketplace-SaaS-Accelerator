## Activate

The below diagram illustrates the flow of information between Azure and the Azure marketplace SDK client application.
![Information flow between Azure and Provisioning application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/media/saas-post-provisioning-api-v2-calls.png)

* On the landing page, review the details presented and click **Activate**
![SaaS Subscriptions](./images/activate-subscription.png)

> The Publisher portal calls the following SaaS SDK API methods in the background.

```csharp
// Determine the details of the offer using the marketplace token that is available in the URL during the redirect from Azure to the landing page.
Task<ResolvedSubscriptionResult> ResolveAsync(string marketPlaceAccessToken);

// Activates the subscription to trigger the start of billing
Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> ActivateSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, string subscriptionPlanID);

```

* Upon successful activation of the subscription, the landing page switches to a view that enlists the subscriptions against the offer.

> You can switch to Azure and note that the **Configure Account** button is replaced by **Manage Account** button indicating that the subscription has been materialized.
> **Note** If activation workflow is enabled, by turning on the flag - **IsAutomaticProvisioningSupported** in the ApplicationConfiguration table, the application would put the subscription in PendingActivation status and the Fulfillment API to activate the subscription is not called. Publisher has the option to activate the subscription via the action menu in the subscription listing in the Publisher Portal.

## Change plan

The below diagram illustrates the flow of information between Azure and the Azure marketplace SDK client application.
![Update subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/media/saas-update-api-v2-calls-from-saas-service-a.png)

Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> ChangePlanForSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, string subscriptionPlanID);

```

>The operation is asynchronous and the call to **change plan** comes back with an operation location that should be queried for status.

```csharp
// Get the latest status of the subscription due to an operation / action.
Task<OperationResult> GetOperationStatusResultAsync(Guid subscriptionId, Guid operationId);
```

> **Note** If activation workflow is enabled, by turning on the flag - **IsAutomaticProvisioningSupported** in the ApplicationConfiguration table, the option to **Change Plan** is disabled for customers.

![Per user pricing](./images/per-user-plan-pricing.png)

> The Publisher portal calls the following SaaS SDK API methods in the background.

```

### Update Plan to indicate per user pricing

```sql
UPDATE Plans SET IsPerUser = 1 WHERE PlanId = '<ID-of-the-plan-as-in-the-offer-in-partner-center>'
```

## Metering

For subscriptions against the plans that support metered billing, a button is enabled to post usage events against the subscription.

> Only one usage event is accepted for the hour interval. The hour interval starts at minute 0 and ends at minute 59. If more than one usage event is emitted for the same hour interval, any subsequent usage events are dropped as duplicates.
> Usage can be emitted with a delay and the maximum delay allowed between is 24 hours.
The usage / consumption is consolidated

## Emit usage events

The following interface in the **Publisher portal** allows the user to manual report the usage against a selected dimension.

> In this example, suppose the SaaS service is offering a notification service that helps its customers send out emails / text. Email and Text are modeled as dimensions and the plan in the marketplace offer captures the definition for charges by these dimensions.

![Report usage](./images/post-usage-event.png)

>Note:
>
> * The option - Manage Usage is available against active subscriptions against a plan that supports metering. You are required to manually update the Plan record in the database to indicate that it supports metering. Besides, the meters for the plan should be initialized in the **MeteredDimensions** table

### Update Plan to indicate support for metering

Use the following script as an example / template to update the records in **Plans**

```sql
UPDATE Plans SET IsmeteringSupported = 1 WHERE PlanId = '<ID-of-the-plan-as-in-the-offer-in-partner-center>'
```

The Plan ID is available in the **Plan overview** tab of the offer as shown here:

![Plan ID](./images/plan-id-for-metering.png)

### Initialize meters for plan

Use the following script as an example / template to initialize meters in **MeteredDimensions** table

```sql
INSERT INTO MeteredDimensions ( Dimension, PlanId, Description, CreatedDate)
SELECT '<dimension-as-in-partner-center', '<id-of-the-plan>', '<description>', GETDATE()
```

The **Dimension** in the above example should be the attribute of a meter in the plan as shown in the below image:
![Meter dimension](./images/meter-dimension.png)

> The SaaS metering service calls the below API to emit usage events

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Emits the usage event asynchronous.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="usageEventRequest">The usage event request.</param>
/// <returns></returns>
Task<MeteringUsageResult> EmitUsageEventAsync(MeteringUsageRequest usageEventRequest);
```

The service tracks the requests sent and the response received from the marketplace metering APIs for auditing purposes.
