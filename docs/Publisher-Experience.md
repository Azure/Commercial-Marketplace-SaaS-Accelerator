![Application Config Page](./images/config-page.png)

* In the **Plans** page, go to the **Events** tab
* Set the emails' recipients under **Success/Failure Event Emails** and mark them as active in the checkboxes under **Active** [To send the email to the customer, enable the **Copy To Customer** flag]

![Plan Events](./images/events-activity.png)

* To add Bcc emails, go to the **Email Template** in the **Application Config** page and add Bcc emails to the appropriate template
* In the **Application Config** page, enable the respective config values to send the emails in different scenarios:
  * To send emails when a subscription is requesting activation, set **IsEmailEnabledForPendingActivation** to **True**
  * To send emails when a subscription is activated, set **IsEmailEnabledForSubscriptionActivation** to **True**
  * To send emails when a subscription is unsubscribed, set **IsEmailEnabledForUnsubscription** to **True**

![Application Config Page](./images/config-page2.png)

## Manage subscriptions

* All the subscriptions purchased will be available under the subscriptions screen.
* The status of each subscription will be available in the list.
* From this screen the actions on the subscriptions like Change Plan, Change Quantity,  Manage Usage, Activate and unsubscribe can be done depending on the status.

## Activate a subscription

The diagram below illustrates the flow of information between Azure and the Azure marketplace SDK client application.
![Information flow between Azure and Provisioning application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/media/saas-post-provisioning-api-v2-calls.png)

* On the subscription page, review the details presented and click **Activate**
![SaaS Subscriptions](./images/activate-subscription.png)

> The Publisher portal calls the following API client methods in the background.

```csharp
// Determine the details of the offer using the marketplace token that is available in the URL during the redirect from Azure to the landing page.
Task<ResolvedSubscriptionResult> ResolveAsync(string marketPlaceAccessToken);

// Activates the subscription to trigger the start of billing
Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> ActivateSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, string subscriptionPlanID);

```

* Upon successful activation of the subscription, the subscription detail page switches to a view that lists the subscriptions against the offer.

> The subscription for the offer on the Azure portal will display  **Manage Account** on the button for the landing page.

> **Note** If activation workflow is enabled, by turning on the flag - **IsAutomaticProvisioningSupported** in the ApplicationConfiguration table, the application would put the subscription in PendingActivation status and the Fulfillment API to activate the subscription is not called. Publisher has the option to activate the subscription via the action menu in the subscription listing in the Publisher Portal.

## Change plan

Pre-requisite: Set "AcceptSubscriptionUpdates" Key in App config to "True". If "False" or Key doesn't exist, updates will be rejected by the webhook.

The diagram below illustrates the flow of information between Azure and the Azure marketplace SDK client application.

![Update subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/media/saas-update-api-v2-calls-from-saas-service-a.png)

* Log on to **Publisher portal**.
* Click **Subscriptions** from the menu on the top, in case you are not on the page that shows you the list of subscriptions.
* The table on this page lists all the subscriptions and their status.
* Click **Change Plan** option in the dropdown menu that appears when the icon under the **Actions** column against any of the active subscriptions is clicked.
![SaaS Subscriptions](./images/customer-subscriptions.png)

* A popup appears with a list of plans that you can switch to.
* Select a desired plan and click **Change Plan**.
  
  ![SaaS Subscriptions](./images/change-plan.png)

> The Publisher portal calls the following API client methods in the background.

```csharp
// Initiate the change plan process
Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> ChangePlanForSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, string subscriptionPlanID);

```

>The operation is asynchronous and the call to **change plan** comes back with an operation location that should be queried for status.

```csharp
// Get the latest status of the subscription due to an operation / action.
Task<OperationResult> GetOperationStatusResultAsync(Guid subscriptionId, Guid operationId);
```

> **Note** If activation workflow is enabled, by turning on the flag - **IsAutomaticProvisioningSupported** in the ApplicationConfiguration table, the option to **Change Plan** is disabled for customers. Publisher has the option to change the plan of the subscription via the action menu in the subscription listing in the Publisher Portal.

## Change quantity

Pre-requisite: Set "AcceptSubscriptionUpdates" Key in App config to "True". If "False" or Key doesn't exist, updates will be rejected by the webhook.

The update to quantity is applicable only for the plans with *per user* pricing model.
  
![Per user pricing](./images/per-user-plan-pricing.png)

The record for the plan needs to reflect the *per user* pricing model. To update the record, see the following script as an example / template to update the records in **Plans**

```sql
UPDATE Plans SET IsPerUser = 1 WHERE PlanId = '<ID-of-the-plan-as-in-the-offer-in-partner-center>'
```

The Plan ID is available in the **Plan overview** tab of the offer as shown here:

![Plan ID](./images/plan-id-for-metering.png)
* Log on to **Publisher portal**.
* Click **Subscriptions** from the menu on the top, in case you are not on the page that shows you the list of subscriptions.
* The table on this page lists all the subscriptions and their status.
* Click **Change quantity** in the menu as shown in the below picture
![Change quantity](./images/change-quantity-menu.png)

* Provide the new quantity and click **Change Quantity** to update the quantity on the subscription
  ![Update quantity](./images/update-quantity-popup.png)


> The Publisher portal calls the following API client methods in the background.

```csharp
Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> ChangeQuantityForSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, int? subscriptionQuantity);
```

> The operation is asynchronous and the call to **Change quantity** comes back with an operation location that should be queried for status.

```csharp
// Get the latest status of the subscription due to an operation / action.
Task<OperationResult> GetOperationStatusResultAsync(Guid subscriptionId, Guid operationId);
```

## Emit usage events

If the plan has custom metering dimensions, the record on the data store needs to reflect it. Use the following script as an example / template to update the records in **Plans**

```sql
UPDATE Plans SET IsmeteringSupported = 1 WHERE PlanId = '<ID-of-the-plan-as-in-the-offer-in-partner-center>'
```

The Plan ID is available in the **Plan overview** tab of the offer as shown here:

![Plan ID](./images/plan-id-for-metering.png)

After marking the plan to reflect the support of meters, use the following script as an example / template to initialize meters in **MeteredDimensions** table

```sql
INSERT INTO MeteredDimensions ( Dimension, PlanId, Description, CreatedDate)
SELECT '<dimension-as-in-partner-center', '<id-of-the-plan>', '<description>', GETDATE()
```

The **Dimension** in the above example should be the attribute of a meter in the plan as shown in the below image:
![Meter dimension](./images/meter-dimension.png)

A button is enabled to post usage events against the subscription if it's plan supports metering.

> Please see the [frequently asked question document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/marketplace-metering-service-apis-faq) for the details about timing of emitting usage events.

The following interface in the **Publisher portal** allows the user to manual report the usage against a selected dimension.

> In this example, suppose the SaaS solution is a notification service that helps its customers send out emails / text. Email and Text are modeled as dimensions and the plan in the marketplace offer captures the definition for charges by these dimensions.

![Report usage](./images/post-usage-event.png)

The SaaS metering service calls the below API to emit usage events

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Emits the usage event asynchronous.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="usageEventRequest">The usage event request.</param>
/// <returns></returns>
Task<MeteringUsageResult> EmitUsageEventAsync(MeteringUsageRequest usageEventRequest);
```

The service tracks the requests sent and the response received from the marketplace metering APIs for auditing purposes.

## Unsubscribe

* Log on to **Publisher portal**.
* Click **Subscriptions** from the menu on the top, in case you are not on the page that shows you the list of subscriptions.
* The table on this page lists all the subscriptions and their status.
* Click **Unsubscribe** against an active subscription.
![SaaS Subscriptions](./images/unsubscribe.png)
* Confirm your action to trigger the deletion of the subscription.

> The Publisher portal calls the following API client methods in the background.

```csharp
// Initiate the delete subscription process
Task<SubscriptionUpdateResult> DeleteSubscriptionAsync(Guid subscriptionId, string subscriptionPlanID);
```

> The operation is asynchronous and the call to **Unsubscribe** comes back with an operation location that should be queried for status.

```csharp
// Get the latest status of the subscription due to an operation / action.
Task<OperationResult> GetOperationStatusResultAsync(Guid subscriptionId, Guid operationId);
```

> **Note** If activation workflow is enabled, by turning on the flag - **IsAutomaticProvisioningSupported** in the ApplicationConfiguration table, the option to **Unsubscribe** is disabled for customers. Publisher has the option to delete the subscription via the action menu in the subscription listing in the Publisher Portal.


## View activity log

* Log on to **Publisher portal**.
* Click **Subscriptions** from the menu on the top, in case you are not on the page that shows you the list of subscriptions.
