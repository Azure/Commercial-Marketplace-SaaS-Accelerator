# Transactable SaaS SDK Database

## Introduction

The customer portal and the publisher portal sample web applications use SQL Server database as the data source to store marketplace subscriptions and the status, metered dimensions by plans, and activity against subscriptions.

## Install Using SQL Scripts

The project uses EntityFramework Core Code-First approach to the database design and maintainance.
When deploying a new version of the accelerator the `dotnet-ef` tool is used to generate a migration script from your current database state to the latest state. All necesary changes will be automatically applied during deployment

When installing the accelerator for the first time, a fresh db creation script is auto-generated based on the latest version of the code and automatically creates the db schema and seeds the initial data required for operation.
