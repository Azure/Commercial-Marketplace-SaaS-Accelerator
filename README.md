## Introduction

This project is a community-supported reference implementation for integrating Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions with Microsoft commercial marketplace SaaS offers. The SaaS Accelerator may be installed as-is or may be customized to support your requirements. The project provides the following capabilities.

1.	A configurable landing page for SaaS customers
2.	A webhook that listens for subscription changes
3.	A private portal for the publisher to monitor customer subscriptions

The project is implemented in .NET and uses the commercial marketplace billing system, including the [SaaS Fulfillment API (v2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2) and [Marketplace Metering Service API.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/marketplace-metering-service-apis). The SaaS Accelerator models how a typical SaaS platform interacts with the marketplace APIs to provision subscriptions for customers, enable logging, and manage commercial marketplace subscriptions.

## Intended Use

This code is a reference implementation of required components of a commercial marketplace SaaS offer and complements the existing commercial marketplace documentation. 

This project accelerates the SaaS offer onboarding experience for those building SaaS solutions for the Microsoft commercial marketplace. Whether installed and used as-is or customized for your particular requirements, this reference implementation provides all main components required by a commercial marketplace SaaS offer.

> NOTE: Support for this project is community-based and contributions are welcome. Details on contributing can be found [below.](https://github.com/Azure/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator#contributing). This is not an officially supported Microsoft product.

## Projects

The source `/src` directory contains the following Visual Studio projects.

| Project | Description | Directory Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**Customer portal - Sample web application**](./src/SaaS.SDK.CustomerProvisioning) | Demonstrates how to register, provision, and activate the marketplace subscription. Implemented using ASP.Net Core 6.0, the sample web application uses the Services client library and data access library to invoke and persist API interactions and provides an example user interface to demonstrate how a customer would manage their subscriptions and plans. |SaaS.SDK.CustomerProvisioning|
| [**Publisher portal - Sample web application**](./src/SaaS.SDK.PublisherSolution) | Demonstrates how to generate usage events used in metered billing transactions, and how to emit these events to the Marketplace Metering Service API. |SaaS.SDK.PublisherSolution|
| [**Client data access library**](./src/SaaS.SDK.Client.DataAccess) | Demonstrates how to persist plans, marketplace subscriptions, and related transaction attributes when using the SaaS Fulfillment API (v2) and Marketplace Metering Service API. |SaaS.SDK.Client.DataAccess |
| [**Services client library**](./src/SaaS.SDK.Services) | Contains the services used by the Customer and Publisher portals, including the POCO classes to orchestrate calls to the marketplace APIs on [client library](https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-dotnet) / database.|SaaS.SDK.Services |
| [**Unit tests project**](./src/SaaS.SDK.UnitTest) | Helps validate and test the SDKs codebase. | SaaS.SDK.UnitTest |

The sample code in this repository runs in the publisher's environment as illustrated below. The metering SDK (.NET class library) and a sample web application to report usage events for subscriptions against those plans that support metering (have the dimensions defined and enabled) and correlate to SaaS Metering and SaaS Service blocks in the below image, respectively.
